# SrgGdHelpers
Godot GDNative Helpers

This is a project containing some helper macros and templates for use with C++ GDNative code. 
These are just conveniences that I'm planning to reuse on other extensions, and seems like
a waste to keep retyping, or copy-pasting the files.  It doesn't have anything that requires
building/compiling, they're just headers.
